/*
 * kafs replacement, main API.
 *
 * This is a simple implementation of the k_hasafs, k_setpag, and k_unlog
 * functions.  It is for use on systems that don't have libkafs or
 * libkopenafs, or where a dependency on those libraries is not desirable for
 * some reason.
 *
 * A more robust implementation of the full kafs interface would have a
 * separate header file with the various system call constants and would
 * support more operations and the k_pioctl interface.  Since this is a
 * stripped-down implementation with only the few functions to do PAG
 * management, various interface constants and system call numbers are
 * hard-coded here.
 *
 * The canonical version of this file is maintained in the rra-c-util package,
 * which can be found at <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/rra-c-util/>.

 *
 * It's really ugly to do this in library or PAM module in so many ways.
 * Static variables are evil, changing signal handlers out from under an
 * application is evil, and the interaction of signals and threads is probably
 * nasty.  The only things that make this better is that this case will never
 * be triggered in the normal case of AFS being loaded and the only time that
 * we change this static variable is to say that the call failed, so there
 * shouldn't be a collision of updates from multiple calls.
 *
 * It's probably safe to just ignore SIGSYS instead, but this feels more
