    Define the correct preprocessor symbols to build properly if a libkafs
    or libkopenafs library was found.

    Mark autodie required for configure and use for correct automated
    testing behavior on Perl 5.10.0.  (autodie was added to core in
    5.10.1.)

AFS::PAG 1.00 (2013-09-12)

    Initial public release with support for libkafs, libkopenafs, and
    Linux systems with no support library.  pioctl is not yet supported,

    been tested on Debian.
