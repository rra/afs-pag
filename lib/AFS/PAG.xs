 * Perl bindings for the libkafs PAG functions.
 *
 * This is an XS source file, suitable for processing by xsubpp, that
 * generates Perl bindings for the PAG functions in the libkafs library or any
 * similar library that provides the same interface.  The module exports those
 * functions to Perl without the k_* prefix, since Perl already has good
 * namespace management for imports.
