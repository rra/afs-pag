BLURB

  AFS::PAG provides the standard PAG and token manipulation functions
  setpag and unlog to Perl programs as a native module.  It also provides
  the hasafs and haspag functions to detect whether AFS is running and
  whether the current process is in a PAG.  Unlike the more general AFS
  module, it will build with any recent OpenAFS, Heimdal's libkafs, or on
  Linux without any AFS libraries at all.

DESCRIPTION

  AFS is a distributed file system allowing cross-platform sharing of
  files among multiple computers.  It associates client credentials
  (called AFS tokens) with a Process Authentication Group, or PAG.
  AFS::PAG makes available in Perl the PAG manipulation functions provided
  by the libkafs or libkopenafs libraries.

  With the functions provided by this module, a Perl program can detect
  whether AFS is available on the local system and whether it is currently
  running inside a PAG.  It can also create a new PAG and put the current
  process in it, and remove any AFS tokens in the current PAG.

  This module doesn't provide a direct way to obtain new AFS tokens, only
  to create a new PAG so that any obtained tokens are isolated from other
  processes on the system and can be inherited by child processes.

REQUIREMENTS

  Perl 5.010, the Config::AutoConf module, and a C compiler are required
  to build this module.  On any platform other than Linux, either the kafs
  library (from Heimdal) or the kopenafs library (from recent versions of
  OpenAFS) are also required.

  The following additional Perl modules will be used by the test suite if
  present:

      IPC::System::Simple
      Test::MinimumVersion
      Test::Perl::Critic
      Test::Pod
      Test::Spelling
      Test::Strict

  All are available on CPAN.  Those tests will be skipped if the modules
  are not available.

  To enable tests that may be sensitive to the local environment or that
  produce a lot of false positives without uncovering many problems, set
  RRA_MAINTAINER_TESTS to a true value.

BUILDING AND INSTALLATION

  AFS::PAG uses Module::Build and can be installed using the same process
  as any other Module::Build module:

      perl Build.PL
      ./Build
      ./Build test
      ./Build install

  If your libkafs or libkopenafs libraries are in a path that's not
  searched by your linker by default, pass them to Build.PL using the
  --extra-linker-flags option, as in:

      perl Build.PL --extra-linker-flags '-L/opt/openafs/lib'

  You will have to run the last command as root unless you're installing
  into a local Perl module tree in your home directory.

SUPPORT

  I welcome bug reports and patches for this package at rra@stanford.edu
  or via the CPAN bug tracker.  However, please be aware that I tend to be
  extremely busy and work projects often take priority.  I'll save your
  mail and get to it as soon as I can, but it may take me a couple of
  months.
