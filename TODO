                           AFS::PAG To-Do List

API:

 * Expose pioctl and find a good way to let callers use it.  This will
   require some way of constructing the pioctl call number and arguments
   from inside Perl, or at least some documented guidance as to how to use
   pack.

Build:

 * Add config.guess and support the libkafs replacement for the other
   operating systems on which it works.  (Mac OS X, Solaris, and other
   system-call-only platforms.)

 * Add the necessary probes to link with OpenAFS libraries on AIX and
   IRIX.

 * Contribute back support for check_func to Config::AutoConf to clean up
   the code in Build.PL.
